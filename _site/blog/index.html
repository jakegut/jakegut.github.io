        <p>The first week involved getting to know more about my mentor and the other REU students. I was also familiarized with the Agile methodology as our of way completing tasks.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Since we know that we’d be using MongoDB as our database, is just now a matter of choosing a language and framework. I have previous experience with Node.js and I know it plays well with MongoDB as JSON is native to both, so I decided to go with Node.js. Node.js is not enough to create a REST API, adding a framework would speed the development process. While I know of Express, I decided to look into other frameworks to see if I can learn something new. However, after looking into other frameworks, I decided that Express would be simple and easy enough to easily develop a prototype while allowing expandability. What I like most about Express is the use of middleware as a way to add simple functionality for the entire web application or for individual routes. I can see myself using middleware in the future to add more features such as authentication.</p>
