For the last week of DREU, I worked on my [final report](files/finalreport.pdf) and made a list of things to work on in the future.

For things to work on, I plan on using something like Kubernetes to orchestrate the various containers in production since it can automatically scale.
Additionally, there might be a race condition when getting individual commits so this would need to be one of the first things that needs to be done before introducing to a larger test case.
