This week, I focused on deploying gitlytics so that I can test it for an extended period of time.

As stated before, I was using Docker Compose to run the various components of gitlyics. Using Docker Compose, I also used it in production on an AWS Lightsail VPS.
While Docker Compose is not recommended for production usage, it should be good enough to test a few GitHub repositories.

After a few days of running it, it seemed to work well for a single GitHub repository I also got a friend of mine to add his personal repository and push to it. While it was a small use case, I'm glad to see gitlytics functioning.
